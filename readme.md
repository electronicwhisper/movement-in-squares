Distorts a checkerboard pattern based on the subject's movement in space. Inspired by [Bridget Riley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Riley).

Uses Quartz Composer, a custom Core Image distortion filter, and the [v002 Open Kinect plug-in](http://kineme.net/forum/Discussion/Programming/v002OpenKinectBeta) by vade.
